Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5" display)6. Cameras don\'t have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ‚Çπ4500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...\n\n', "\n\n  I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.\n\n", "\n\n  Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.\n\n", '\n\n  "Phone\'s Temperature" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen.....

Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.\n\n', '\n\n  Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use..

Camera performance is average. Processor SD 625 is aged not the latest (but still good). Battery life is sufficient. SIM ejector pin is too small may get lost (careful!). Has got a notification LED on bottom. Has most of the decent sensors (Compass, Step, Gyro etc.). Has IR Blaster.The phone looks identical to other Redmi phones. The display is the main attraction.Overall performance is average, don't expect huge from this phone at this price segment. Good for average user.\n\n", '\n\n  This is my 4th Xiaomi phone in last 3 yrs and this is the worst one I got. This phone is a mess. I am not sure why Xiaomi is not fixing the issues on this phone. I wasted my money on this. This has got horrible cons like:1. this phone will never show you notificaiton icon at status bar. So basically, you will get a sound or vibration that something app has got a notification but you cant see at the phone screen top status bar which is something a 3rd class phone also shows. So this means you will have either have to slide down the top of screen to check the hidden status bar or foolishly keep sliding and check which App has a notification. Worst experience.2. Screen is sluggish  to navigate, slow one.3. Sound out put is not that good.4. Camera is average.5.MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly. I was using redmi note 5 pro and it was far better.  I bought this one just because of smaller size to easily fit into pocket. i am regretting now.Verdict: Better go for redmi note 5 pro and avoid this one atleast.\n\n', '\n\n  I just bought it 14 days back....

A handy epic phone.....MI at its Best ....Love from MI Fan üòçüòç\n\n', "\n\n  There are so many their own apps which are not even required. They are forcing us to use their apps only instead of standard google apps. We cannot even remove them and disable them. It will eat up your mobile battery. Why do they provide their own apps if there are apps available from google? Do they think they can developed better apps than google? A big joke!!! I'll never buy any Xiomi phone again in my life.\n\n", '\n\n  Though this phone have good screen, its speed and user experience is the worst.even for small stuff like changing the orientation of screen through autorotate, picking up a call, switching between apps, picture review after capturing etc. it took seconds. which is really annoying for such daily tasks.it hangs too much and is very slow for day to day operation. its bulky and weights a bit high. front cam is very poor like that of china phones. rear cam is pretty good but it takes quite a time for consecutive pictures.when u use external sd card it slows down even further.battery is big but din‚Äôt support fast charge so be ready for long charging schedules. its notch display management is very bad. for example the video plays with black space on both the side of screen. meaning no extended video play on notch like that of iphone.so notch is kinda useless. it works only to show different icons.at the end I wont recommand it.with all the good qualities it lakes very fundamental thing that is processing power.looks good but very irritating to operate.\n\n', '\n\n  I have purchased Redmi 6 Pro in Amazon end of October 2018.I was on tour in Rajasthan state. On 19th November 2018 my phone started giving some problem in Net connectivity. On 20th November 2018 around 3.30PM I went to MI Authorized Service Center, Arihant Telecom, ‚ÄúNarayan Niwas‚Äù Near Hotel Hadi Rani, Inside Udaipole, Udaipur.A lady sitting in the reception checked the handset and said there is a problem in Software and she asked for the invoice copy. I said it was purchased from Amazon and you can verify in your computer. Immediately, she refused and demanded the soft copy. I said there is net problem in the handset and I cannot get immediately. Then she has shown me a number written on the wall and advised me to talk to them. In spite of my repeated requests also she has not attended my phone.I told her, madam it was purchased just 15 to 20 days back it is a brand new piece. It is having full warranty. Then also she just doesn‚Äôt care and said as per my company instructions without invoice copy I cannot attend.Immediately, after coming out from that service center, I have purchased a new mobile of Nokia Company.It is my blunder mistake in choosing MI product. I want to take legal steps in the matter.\n\n', "\n\n  Screen-great as ppi is very much.Sound-You can't expect more than this from phone's speaker.Battery-Godd because of 4000 mAh.Camera-Quality  is good but disappoints as blur is very little. In zenfone M1 you can adjust the blur.Processor should've been upgraded.LED is only of white colour. I don't know why they discontinued the colourful LED. It helps us to recognise notification in off  screen too. Well competitor Realme doesn't have LED.The improvement they can do is to give feature of adjustable blur effect in portrait mode. And please give those colourful LED notification back.\n\n", '\n\n  I received a defect product, the power button is dead and quality of pictures are also not good.\n\n', '\n\n  CONS1. I felt intermittent mild shock on back panel when I am using phone.2. There are few MI inbuilt apps which we can neither uninstall nor avoid annoying their ads. They self update even after selecting the option "Don\'t update" in settings.3. I\'ve used MI Redmi 4 before whose battery was same as this, 4000mah. Comparing the discharge rate with my usage this discharges quick(even aft disabling face unlock).4.Sometimes I don\'t get my downloaded photos and videos in gallery/file managerPROS1. Rear camera is decent and less noises due to high quality sensors2. This is one of the few phone which has less screen size with notch display(this is for those who like small screens)3. Sound is loud and good.4. Durable, as I slipped many times and fell on screen the display didn\'t break.\n\n', "\n\n  when you first look the phone it seems very pretty but performance wise i don't like this phone.1 the 5 megapixel front camera for selfies is a tiny bit unsatisfactory and leaves it for improvement.2 even though you may not find any particular heating issues, it may seem that the redmi 6 pro stutters slightly while playing heavy games.3 it does not support fast charging.4 face unlock works efficiently in low light which is a significant security concern since anyone maybe capable of unlocking your phone.5 Weight wise 178gm which is slightly heavy as compared to other phone in the same price range and of same battery size.One thing i really like and appreciate mi for notification light. i love that notification light.\n\n", '\n\n  Purchased this item in first sale after launch, thinking redmi cant fool the customerspros-Display, batteryCons-1.No dual 4G standby ( means  a combination of Jio and airtel/Vodafone cant be used) this is biggest drawback.  even lower variant Redme 6A has this option, i dont know why Mi has not kept this feature in this, its nust requiremrnt now a days, i just purchased it thinking that this option available2.Worst front camera-front cam pics will be crap, even gets worst with low light3.rear camera- not upto the mark, Bokeh mode doesent work properly4.Display broken (may be my negligence), but fallen from just 3-4 feet heightonly, so delicate...???earlier i have used honor phone, once in a train,my honor mobile fallen on to floor from upper berth not even a single hairline crack, sooo solid..OVER ALL- not a good product form Mi or Redmi, i was first time buyer of redmi, it just fooled me...DONT GO FOR IT GUYS\n\n', '\n\n  Bought this phone as a surprise gift for my wife on her birthday last month and before the start of Great Indian Sale on Amazon. I believe I bought it in the 1st flash sale only on 2nd October. Amazon Pay EMI experience was smooth and delivery was quick as always. Posting this crisp review after a month use of Redmi 6 Pro (3 GB/32 GB).Pros:1) Brilliant full HD display2) Good build quality3) Great Network reception4) Seamless 4G connectivity on both SIMs5) Fast Snapdragon 626 Octacore processor6) Good RAM management (No Lags)7) Good primary camera (13+5 MP) with added features8) IR Blaster (Universal Remote)9) Greater Gaming Experience (PUBG & Asphalt 9 with no lags)10) MI UI 9.5 gives good overall user experience including a greater battery management.Cons:1) 5 MP Selfie Camera at a starting price point of 11 K is totally unjust.2) No wide angle lens on front cam3) Front cam sensor could have been better to counter RealMe 24) The 2 cam setup in primary camera fails to generate great pictures with depth (Bookeh) effect.5) Secondary 5 MP depth effect cam is not integrated well to generate greater depth effect (Expecting a camera software update soon for improved experience).6) Primary camera sometimes struggles to focus on non-human object while taking still pictures7) Single speaker could have been a bit better8) 5.84 inch FHD screen is good but a 6 inch screen could have been much betterOverall its a good phone considering the fact that its the very first phone from MI with a notch screen however it certainly lacks that one great punch in front camera department. At least a quick software update is must to enhance the overall quality of the images produced by its 5 MP selfie cam.\n\n', '\n\n  I am using this mobile from 20 days, below are my observation :1. Look & Feel : Beautiful2 Battery : Its not 2 days battery back up, even battery get discharged very fast, but yes battery works for single day.3. Camera : Awesome, both back as well as front.4. Charger : Fast charging, idk why but they delivered Y2 charger.Only Battery is the issue, otherwise mobile is really Good\n\n', "\n\n  I would like to highlight few issues which I observed compared to other mobiles although it's better for the price he is giving.1. If I click on any link, it takes through MI browser instead of chrome and I did not see option to select chrome as default browser it's a big pain. Very very difficult to uninstall MI apps by general public, he should have knowledge on how software works in order to uninstall.2. Max volume & Brightness is less when compared to other mobiles.3. Display clarity is little low even when compared with Lenevo K6 Power.4. New work reception & net speed is 20% less.5. Lot of times finger unlock is not working.6. Bluetooth signal breaks if mobile placed in back picked it has become a pain while Jogging and cycling.7. Display size is not what we imagine before buying, few notifications on top centre hidden as speaker and sensor r placed in display.\n\n", "\n\n  I didn't find the battery part more attractive but yeah its good. The look of this phone is just superb. A very good pick if you are a student.\n\n", "\n\n  The Redmi 6 pro is among the best mobiles you can buy at this price range. Let me put down some of the pro's and con's of this mobile.Pros1. Value for money.2. Good design and build quality. Size is perfect.3. Rear camera is good, its the same setup as in Redmi note 5 pro.4. FHD screen with notch display5. Good battery life and no heating issues.6. Face recognition + fingerprint login7. Dedicated micro SD card slot. You can have 2 micro sims and an SD card.Cons.1. The front camera is just average and its bad in low light conditions .2. Snapdragon 625 is a bit old now, it's been around a while.3. Nothing much new apart from the notch display in this phone. So if you're not a fan of notch display, then you can ignore it.4. Not meant for high intensity graphic games. I don't play games but I tested PUBG and it was below average.5. I'm not fan of MIUI. Too many advertisements and its another revenue model for Xiaomi. The company has admitted  its one way to reduce the cost of Mi phones.6. Same old micro USB port, no type C. Its fine since you don't see type C port at this price range.7. Face unlock is average, it works only with good lighting8. Sunlight screen visibility is pathetic. You can't see anything outdoors under bright sunlight.Overall I found Redmi 6 pro a very good phone. As I've mentioned earlier there is nothing much new apart from the notch display when compared to other Mi phones.\n\n", "\n\n  Dnt purchase the Red Mi 6 pro.It has very cheap battery... It's getting drain very fast. There is no any 2 days battery life ,it's end within some Hours\n\n", '\n\n  The design has never been the forte of Xiaomi phones. The company continues to use a combination of metal and plastic for the back panel. Some cosmetics changes that have been made but the overall look and feel isn‚Äôt all that different from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. It‚Äôs still more of the same thing.\n\n', '\n\n  Look nice. Battery OK 1.5 days.  Nouch no use. Sound avg. Notification bar nothing unread item shows. But software may upgrade may there. Battery max 1.5 days. Refer photo. MI playing with add every where. So believe no security to our files and data. I hate this mob.\n\n', '\n\n  This mobile comes WITHOUT google services, installing GOOGLE PLAY is NOT THAT SIMPLE.  Out of 4 GB RAM only 2.1 GB available without any new app installation/opening. Display size mentioned is 5.84 inch but display width is 5 mm less compared to other Redmi Note  5.5inch display phone. No dedicated Menu-Navigation button on hard case but optional soft button appears on screen, after this the effective screen size is LESS in all respective compared to all 5.5 inch phone. But over all physical lower width gives a BETTER grip on hand. The SIM tray having two Nano SIM plus dedicated SD slot together is very very delicate to handle. Notification light is on bottom left corner so in little darkness phone is always picked up in upside down manner if notification light is glowing. Top notification bar is really very very tiny. Data /Wifi connection speed, Mobile network name, alarm clock active or not etc can only be seen after pulling down the top menu bar but not in standard on screen display. Overall the front camera wrap around display is nothing but projecting calculated bigger display when it is practically less. Somehow in WhatsApp voice call screen does not wake up and I could not sort it out anyway. Speaker volume found be lower compared to my other 2 Redmi phones. Speaker position is on bottom edge not on the backside thus keeping phone on a surface does not affect loudspeaker quality. Signal strength Ok, Sound quality OK.\n\n', '\n\n  The Phone is the most flopped model of redmi, i exchanged Redmi note 5 pro for this phone and this phone ia total disaster.Pros:Looks sleek and stylish like iphoneEasy to hold display size and design.Cons:The 3 gb ram phone is dead slow when we toggle between appsGaming experience is terrible, the screen freezes most of the timeThe fingerprint unlock takes quiet some time to unlock the phoneCamera clarity is of very bad qualityWatching movie for 3 hours will drain the battery completely.The phone can be of good review with the senior citizens, as they will not bug/use the phone much.\n\n', "\n\n  After many comparisions and eliminations finally ordered this.Positives1.

Somewhat heavy2. Face unlock is not instant3. When you press power button you need to wait 20 sec to see the screen.4 when your phone call is done, you need to wait till others cut the call as you may not see the screen immediately after phone call.5 replaced my phone 2 times in Hope of solving 3 and 4.  No use.  So the product itself is corrupt not just my piece of phone6 . Even after all kinds of troubleshoots by me and technician.  Basic issues not solved. So returned my phone even though I love its features and looks , it has serious ‚Äôscreen goes blank' issues.We always click power button to unlock our phone.. but when you click power button it takes at least 20 seconds to show you screen.. just try to wait 20 seconds on any phone for unlock and if you are okay, this is the best phone in recent times in this budget. :-) all the best\n\n", '\n\n  Initially i had a great confusion of which phone to buy for my wife, then had two options in mind One was Vivo which my family members are using for past three years, another was Redmi, but thought let ,me go for redmi this time and to be very frank this is a very best phone that anyone can afford with all latest options and features, very good phone for the price paid, people who wanted to buy a cheap and best phone please buy Redmi Phones\n\n', "\n\n  Phone is not working properly, when I make a call, the person of others side can't hear me when I got a call then the person can hear\n\n", "\n\n  All are Normal good not a amazing and one mager problem are phone is charging time very high hitting so I don't like and I have riturn this product\n\n", '\n\n  Good product for those who want a handy phone at quite a good price\n\n', '\n\n  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is powered by 2GHz octa-core (8x2GHz) processor and it comes with 4GB of RAM.

If u r making a great product in low budget thn u don‚Äôt need to advertise. advertise works rarely u can take example of vivo.

Sound is awesome, screen without notch would have been better, but we can live with the notch. The full screen video avoids notch. Quick finger sensor. Button quality is good. Phone was accidentally under water for almost 5 mins, and yet turned out to be a champ, so nice work there.Cons:Selfie disappoints you so much that your wife threatens to leave you. Definitely not a phone for selfie lovers. Back cam is a decent one, but fails royally in indoors, low light, artificial light, but considering it as a low end, can be lived with.Notch is annoying, specially when it renders full screen useless. Speed is good. Gaming is average.\n\n', '\n\n  I have been using the phone for a week now. Here is my short review:Price: 12999 - Discounts = 11500/- ApproxPros:Battery life is really good.Cons:Really bad call quality. It sounds like someone has gone in the past and is talking on GTalk using a slow internet connection (The voice is clipped too much)Night photos look too badRest, which are ok:Screen quality is good.Loudspeaker sound is moderate, not too weak but not very loud as well.Build quality is goodI guess you should look for another options in this price range.\n\n', '\n\n  Got 3gb version at 8999. I am writing this review after 10 days use. It appeared to be bit big screen before buying, however after actually holding it in hand feels easy to operate. Bit heavier due to large battery capacity. The display, battery and camera are definitely above average. Touch feedback is awesome. Plus it has very useful IR blaster. 9nly down side is quick charge function. However with so many other plus points, this is best buy under 10k category\n\n', "\n\n  Yes the title sums it all. This is the worst mobile from Xaomi stable .I have been a Xaomi fan and it has been my 2nd phone always used for games, gps and other activities which I dont want my main phone to drain with.Earlier used Mi Phone, Redmi 4 and then Redmi Note 5 pro. All the above have passed with flying colors in terms of battery , not hanging and even camera (Which I rarely use on my secondary phone.) Redmi Note 5 pro is still the best from the stable with Performance, Battery and superb camera.Since I bought Redmi 6 pro, I have problems.a. Maps don't work as it crashes each time I start using direction.b. Battery is not great , even with limited uses max it stays for 36 hours.c. Apps crashing. Many of the apps keep crashing specifically after the update to MIUI 10d. The touch of the phone is not great as going back and front sometimes can be tough , need to double touch couple of times.So avoid buying this phone, instead buy the redmi note 5 pro.But I guess every company will have one bad product so I feel for Xaomi this is that one product. The faster they scrape manufacturing of this it is better. Don't ruin the image just because of this phone.This review is after nearly 5 months of extensive usage.\n\n", '\n\n  Within 4 days of use, serious issues in sound quality. No voice to other person on outgoing calls. Checked different sims also same issue.\n\n', '\n\n  Camera quality not better as per show on amazon.Software system good\n\n', "\n\n  Received this unit during great sale event and in exchange of my existing phone. Delivery and exchange experience was excellent as usual.About Phone:The basic requirement for a new phone for me was to have a phone of smaller size (to be able to operate in one hand most of time), long battery life, larger RAM & Storage, standard physical protection (for usual scratches & small bumps) and no heating problem during long calls. I use this phone for official number in which long calls are quite usual.I am generally satisfied with the phone as it meets most of the above criteria. Battery life usually is about 2 days (around 2 hrs of total call time, some youtube videos, whatsapp, sms, etc.). However, it seems that the screen is not having any protection. It got scratched in first week of usage without any single hard bump or scratching.The phone loudspeaker is average at best; can't use it in a noisy environment at all. Call on speaker is ok in a quite location. It is not at all suiting for any quality music playing.Another unexpected issue is the Camera quality. Though the rear camera is a two-camera set-up, but the quality of the images, especially a little low light conditions are very bad. Also, there is no macro mode. Minimum distance is about 1.5m. Front camera is even worse. The quality of the selfies are actually worse than 2 year older phones.The MIUI 10 is yet to be updated. From the general information available in the market it is understood that it should get quite few important upgrades.The phone is generally value for money as a phone (for calls, SMSs, Whatsapp, etc.). But if one is looking for a media device, it would be better to look for alternatives.\n\n", '\n\n  Bought this phone Oct 11 for gifting and when I received the phone was working fine. And it already 70 % charge and was not used for a week. A week later this phone is getting charged and as per MI toll free customer care I got it repaired from MI service centre. It wrked for 6-7 hours and again , it will not get charged. Now amazon says return period is over and MI customer care says I should re try repair until phone is fine .Wasted my money going behind MI and couldnt use the new phone for a single day also\n\n', "\n\n  I have had used Mi note 5 pro for 5 months, now recently i bought mi 6 pro, after using both the phones i can say that Mi 6 looks, handling are better than Mi note 5 pro. mi 6 pro's  Display Quality Is way better than mi note 5. performance wise both were almost similar. Few advantage with mi note 5 pro is Ram,  screen size and few others  Which are really ignore-able when compare to the offered price. Mi note 5 pro Is almost 50% expensive than mi 6 pro ie. 4k - 5k .  When Compared to Mi note 5 pro with mi 6 pro, i would  vote for Mi 6 pro - reasons :- 1. quality 2. performance. 3 Pocket friendly.\n\n", "\n\n  \xa0I gave gift to my mother and she is not heavy user.she gave me feedback that this phone got slower with storage filling.i check myself it is got slow with update and storage filling to 80%.i literally don't recommend this phone either invest money on MI A2. that one is better with stock android.After a month use i found the problem..if u hold phone just by top corners ur screen will be wiped off. This phone has serious issue\n\n", "\n\n  The product is priced too high for the specs it is providing when there are a lot of other devices available at a much affordable price loaded with amazing features.This is a very disappointing device by mi. Coming to the cons by noticing this price of Rs 11k :-1) No dual volte support, even the lower model redmi 6 has that feature (which is priced at only 8000rs),but not available on the model which is priced at 11,000 rs. Mi is just fooling customers with this model.2) below average front camera quality, only 5mp.3) again the same boring design of phone.4) notch design makes the phone look ugly, it could be better (but mi hasn't worked seriously on this).5)outdated processor, especially at this price point when others are providing sd 636 at same price(e.g - Asus zenfone max m1 pro)6) display quality is also not that much great whn compared to asus, honor or other devices at 12k price range.7) screen size also looks quite small due to notch on the top.. Its should be 6 inch.Pros of this device -1) good battery, 4000 mah.2) solid metal built quality.3) dual rear cameras is somewhat of good. Quality( but not great at all) .P. S - honestly saying, this is not a worthy phone, better to go. With redmi note 5 pro. At a. Slightly higher price otherwise go for Asus or honor or real me.They are providing much better value for money.Mi seriously needs to work at its strategy after seeing the stiff competition in thd market currently.This phone should be priced at only 8k.\n\n", '\n\n  Pros:- Budget friendlyGood battery lifeBack camera is goodConsFront camera is medium..

(google camera mod doesn't work with front camera, so no comments)Rear camera- stock cam app- it takes good avg photos in daylight ,not stunning or eye catching through.Google cam mod- this makes entire world of difference through, the detailing lighting is great with gcam, Night vision also works great , portrait shots with gcam sometimes cant detect edges properly and only works with human object/faces ..(if u comfortable with unlocking rooting, go do it and install gcam mod, may void warranty through)Display - 4.5/5clearity is superb here. switching from note 5 pro, 6pro's display produces great colors, brightness levels are also upgraded.Notch-space around the notch is kind of useless ,it always shows network,battery and clock all the time, And doesn't show any notification icons,u have to drag notification drawer.BATTERY -4/5backup is great ,on normal usage easily last 1 and half day.Sound- 4/5loudspeaker /main speaker- sound is clear,somewhat deep, and has avg level of loudness, no problems here.Earpiece/incall speaker-its small speaker but i would say quality is great, loudness is also above average , speaker is upgraded here.Earphone Jack- sound amplifier for jack is great ,i've used sennheiser CX-213, ..( install V4A with well know profiles, root and unlocking required here)I wont recommend this device as it doesn't worth 11k, instead go for note 5 pro.\n\n", "\n\n  Earlier I was worried about which phone to purchase on sale.

Cheaper than other brands with same configuration2. Camera (front & back) quality is good3. Fingerprint unlock is good4. Looks professional, sleek and light weight5. User friendly interface6. Came in excellent packaging without any damageCons:1. Battery for first year was good.  But post that it starts to drain fast even with minimal usage / idle time2. Requires mobile phone case / protector because rear camera is aligned with body and hence if kept on table / other surface, the lens would get scratches and thus making the camera unusable.3. There are multiple Mi apps that are installed by default by the manufacturer and runs in background (probably would be collecting and sharing personal data) which cannot be stopped or uninstalled.\n\n', "\n\n  3gb ram 32 GB storage. Camera is okay for casual use not a high end. With miui 10 there were many bugs fixed. Network connection is good. Call quality is good. Sound through speakers is better. Touch is better. I hate the notch but you can hide it. A single notification light for all purposes. It takes 2 1/2 hr to 3 hr for full charging with the provided charger. Charger cable is short. No ear phones. Has a very good battery life but with mobile internet on it drains out a little bit faster than on wifi. Touch is great.loaded with lots of mi apps and many can't be uninstalled.

Overall built quality is nice but it is kinda plastici finish, enough loud in speaker and it is also good in headphones. Phone is fast due to processor (even it may be due to brand new product and not that heavily used), overall performance is very nice and impressive, but I felt little heating if used heavily / multitasked but heating is not that major to worry about. Camera quality is decent in the price range; i would say not that impressed but still it fetches decent photographs in bright sunlight,but it struggles in low light. In comparison with RealMe, this phone has lot to improve in camera processing department. But you should not expect too much in this price range. Battery performance is very decent and it will last you whole day, but it is very slow in charging, as for me it took roughly 2:30hrs to charge from zero to 100%. But overall phone is worth buying...\n\n', "\n\n  Google play store doesn't works properly and while downloading even a 10 mb app it's takeing too much of time so overall it's not at all satisfied and Amazon return policy is also too worst , even we can't return this mobile after delivery so please don't buy anything from Amazon\n\n", "\n\n  HiI have brought this phone on THE GREAT INDIAN SALES Oct 11. Order got delivered on 15th October..This is the honest review after one month of usage.I know lot of people are too lazy to read such a long para review and thus for those People I give a three line review..This phone is definitely a best phone only to got it for a price of 10k. Don't go for the 4GB ram varient which is 13k, instead go for redmi note 6 pro which is about 14k to 15k..And the Detailed Review is as follows as*Design*:Design is simply superb.. Phone is cute and this black color is even Sexy*MIUI*:  I am stock android lover and am new to this miui.. At 1st i struggled, later i loved this UI. XIAOMI promised me MIUI 10 but i haven't received yet..*Battery* : Battery ahh nothing to say am astonished this is the 1st time i am charging once a day.. Thnx to the huge 4000mah battery..Charging time : 2 hrs 10 min from 15% to 100%And it last minimum 1 day and maximum 1.5 days ( even 2days depends upon usage)But the charger wire is short, needs special place and arrangements for charging..*Camera* : This is a place where I get disappointed.. Yes camera is average.. Rear camera has good hardware but the portrait shots are below average.. Front camera uses software to create portraits and it is more better than the rear camera.. The camera is the only place where this phone fails to meet expectations..May be XIAOMI can fix it by a update..*Performance* :Yeah XIAOMI uses SD 625 here little disappointed but ok for this price segment.. Using for a month i didn't face any lag, heating issue etc..*Security* :This phone has face unlock and it works well even in slight dark atmosphere and the finger print sensor is Lightning Fast...*Conclusion* :This phone comes with all sensors and IR BLASTER is rocking.. I control everything with this phone... MIUI gives more custom options..I exchanged old phone and got this phone.. I got lot of offers for this phone.Thus 11k phone i got for ‚Çπ5000 appoxAlso I got free screen replacement for one yearBut for othersU can get it for 10k using any bank offer..It's worth every penny even for 10k..But i wont suggest the 4Gb varient which is sold for 13k.. Instead u can go for other optionsThank you ‚ù§\n\n", "\n\n  Mobile is completely worth for the money . I have been using it for almost 2months now and I never felt issues . I play games a lot and haven't faced any heating issues . Don't get confused with the other comments above . I donno whether they really purchased Redmi 6 pro or not üòÖ.Photography is pretty good . They could have did much better in the portrait mode and it depends on the MIUI updates . So it's not that bigger issue.Like all the other Xiaomi phones even this got a good battery life .Overall I'm satisfied with the brought of this phone..and I'm sincerely genuine in reviewing it. ‚úåÔ∏è\n\n", '\n\n  Redmi 6 pro is very good mobile in all respects except sound quality. Picture quality, front and back camera are very good. Battery life is also very good. With data on full day and extensive use of net for 9 hours, the battery ‚ÑÖ falls from 100% to 75%. I am highly satisfied with this product except sound quality. I listen bluetooth speaker but the Equaliser does not work at bluetooth mode. This problem is common to all MI mobiles.\n\n', '\n\n  The only thing this phone excels is in its great looks. All other aspects feel cheap about this phone.The biggest let down is browsing. Multiple windows hangs the phone. The google map another problem. It takes forever to show directions even when updated(update- the Google map is working normal now). The phone in general feels very slow and unresponsive. I used to use Redmi note 4 and was quite impressed by its performance.Battery life is just decent. Camera is good.\n\n', '\n\n  Here‚Äôs what you get inside the box:1. Handset2. Charger (5V 2A)3. USB charging cable4. Sim ejector pin5. Translucent CaseDesign:The design of Note 6 Pro same as that of Note 5 Pro so nothing special here. The build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. Rating 8/10.Display:The display on the front is a Full HD 6.3-inch notch display with 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. It is covered with a 2.5D glass which gives it a premium look. The notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. I think Xiaomi could have done a bit better here. Big notches mean less space for notification icons so that‚Äôs not great. Rating 8/10.Battery:The phone comes with a 4000 mAh battery which is also same as Note 5 Pro. So, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. One nice improvement in Note 6 Pro is that Quick Charge 3.0 is available now. The phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. Rating 10/10.Audio:The speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. The audio via the earphone is average if you don‚Äôt tweak the settings. So, I‚Äôd recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. Rating 8.5/10.Performance:The Note 6 Pro runs on same Snapdragon 636. Snapdragon 636 is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. App opens and close fast. Gaming is smooth as well. If you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 6GB RAM variant. Rating 8.5/10.Security:Both fingerprint sensor and face unlock work well on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate while the Face unlock takes a bit of time (less than a second) to unlock the device. Face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so don‚Äôt use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. Rating 9/10.Pricing:During Launch, the pricing of Note 6 Pro was a bit of a surprise because Note 5 Pro price was increased from 13999 to 14999 and the Note 6 Pro packs some nice improvements over the 5 Pro so a price increase of 1000 was expected. But instead, Xiaomi launched it at 1000 less i.e. 13999 which was fair enough or good pricing. But as of now when the price dropped for another 2 to 3 bucks, its really a great deal for this phone. Rating: 8/10.Camera:When Redmi Note 5 Pro launched earlier this year, it had one of the best camera in its price range and now Note 6 Pro comes with an improved camera. The aperture and pixel size has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. In earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations.The front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. The performance of front camera is good as well. Pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. The dynamic range wasn‚Äôt great though.The camera is impressive. Few camera samples are included in this review, more samples will be added on the final review on our website. Rating 8.5/10.SummaryOverall, Redmi Note 6 Pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 13999, we think it offers good value for money. If you have a budget of around 15000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then Note 6 Pro should be your choice.If you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X are good options.If you already have the Note 5 Pro, then you should skip the Note 6 Pro as it is not that big of an upgrade.\n\n', '\n\n  Mi phones have a lot of advertisements now, that are everywhere on all the useless extra software they install (it helps them make a little bit of money )Takes quite some time to follow a thorough internet guide to sit and uninstall all the bloatware apps one by one and then denying them permissions to flash advertisements individually. In fact It makes you wait 10 seconds per app to revoke permissions for collecting your data and then flashing adverts.Since this is a known issue.. whoever buys it should be tech savvy enough to go about turning such stuff off or take the help of a tech savvy friend to do the same.Once the phone is setup by a tech savvy person.. its hardware software combo is shockingly good for the price. It just works.. and efficiently.. Much more than a day of mixed usage.Even if you do not remove all the adverts that keep flashing.. the battery life is good, but then the adverts are ANNOYING. Even the System Cleaner software advertises tons of flashing junk Adverts after its done cleaning!But it for the battery life, And severely good hardiness which is better than the basic 6 because it is thicker to house the larger battery and fairs very well in all the strange drop test videos i saw on the internet before deciding to purchase this model.The MIUI interface is super smooth as usual, this is my 4th MI phone purchased and I also use a their TV and the incredible wifi router (which again has unbelievable software based options only available by brands selling at 5 times higher cost). So yes, this being the 6th Mi product i bought since 2014, I trust the quality.Only issue is you really have to get all tech savvy to get rid of the advertisements. I wish MI stops doing this new trend, there are too many adds. the Finger Print sensor  and face unlock, both work well and even though earlier I had ignored using them before, its a much happier faster experience to use it. However it is not as fast as the flagship models. But not a deal breaker.All in all i would like to say.. The first Redmi 1s i had bought in 2014, still looks brand new and works (but battery life went down and MI does not sell battery for that model after 5 years now) Based on that I expect this one will last 3 to 5 years aswell if treated right.\n\n', "\n\n  Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.\n\n", '\n\n  ABSOLUTELY AMAZED BY THE WAY XIAOMI HAS RUINED THIS PHONE!Pros:Good screen qualityGood battery lifeCons:1)Front camera is absolute crap, images are too noisy and blurry.2) Network reception. This is the biggest problem that I have faced with this phone.The network reception is just too weak. It keeps fluctuating alot and also it keeps changing between 2g and 4g .Call quality is also not that great, your voice sounds muffled to the other person. The earpiece is also not that loud.3) Performance : RAM Management has not been done well in this phone . Out of 3Gb , I just had 800Mb free out of the box.MIUI has ads. Who puts ads in the UI!?? This is absolutely ridiculous. The UI is not smooth ,it\'s laggy and glitches alot. 4)Rear so called "Dual camera" : The secondary camera is just a gimmick. It\'s just a depth sensor that comes into play when you take portrait shots. Many phones just do the background blurring in portrait shots using AI.Dual camera is just for name sake here.5) Build quality : This phone is not ALL-METAL!I\'ve seen some reviews mentioning that it\'s an all metal body. It is not , It\'s a polycarbonate body.6)Heating issues : Heats up alot when mobile data and location is turned on.FORGET ABOUT PLAYING GAMES ON THIS PHONE.WHEN IT CANT HANDLE BASIC TASKS , PLAYING GAMES IS JUST A DREAM.BASICALLY WHAT IN TRYING TO SAY IS : DONT BUY THIS PHONE. MY HONEST OPINION. I BOUGHT THE PHONE , IM SUFFERING.THERE ARE MANY BETTER OPTIONS OUT THERE. DONT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS PHONE.\n\n', "\n\n  With a big, bright screen, capable camera and very strong battery life, the Redmi Note 6 Pro makes a great impression - even with poor software, no NFC and an outdated micro USB port.But the touch response gets too much sensitive, makes call from contacts automatically (due to touch response)Network isn't that much great, where as Redmi 7 Pro handle network signal good enough.\n\n", "\n\n  The worst design of notch which makes the area around of less use. The screen is a bit smaller if u were using 6' or more before and so the width . The new phone was a bit laggy and choppy , PUBG crashed twice while playing and even the controls are a bit scattered around the screen as the lenth to breadth ratio isnt perfect so you will not be comfortable to play mobile games. Even at the lowest graphics Games can be choppy. Camera isnt that great nor the processsor .

For the techie people, who look at all the indepth details, you may keep struggling endlessly in the similar price range as for every 500 rs. There's an upgrade which on paper is good but may not translate to real world .vi actually picked it for the smaller screen size and ppi along with battery life.  When I purchased, it was the best bang for buck in the range.

It has very nice feel in hand. I have small hands, and did not want a big phone. This phone is "not wide" and long. The notch was the reason I purchased this model, but the novelty wears off after some days and the notch is more of a problem than a feature as of now. There are updates fixing the issue, but I\'m enjoying the adventures of everyday bugs of notch.Battery is good, I charge once in two days, I\'m not a heavy user.\n\n', "\n\n  This mobile can't work dual 4g volt stand by mode. It is very big disadvantage, now all mobile coming on dual volte your also try realme , asus\n\n", '\n\n  Really worth for the priceThe most attracting is its battery life upto 1 and half day with average use..display quality is also a plus point..after mi ui update camera also get improved and feels good .sound quality feels like dolby .totally redmi has completely changed its platform by this one . some demerits also am mentioning take little bit more time to charge than i expect. Can only use one 4g provider at a time. Portrait mode is little disappointing..low light also..dedicated sim slot is a plus point so dont bother about 32 gb. And snapdragon 625 is performing good with 3gb ram.. Overall pretty good in look with notch (1st in mi series).Comparing with the competator nokia 5.1 plus 6 pro is so far better and the most worth phone by its price (11k)\n\n', "\n\n  Redmi 6 pro doesn't have option to show stats bar icons.and front camera quality is not good.A phone without status bar icon is complete useless I think.And it's notch is also useless. Disappointed with the product..\n\n", '\n\n  Amazon and Mi. How did you guys allow a faulty phone get into the market and then put it under replacement warranty for only "7 days"??!! Its ridiculous. The phone started hanging within one and half months, with the constant need for reboot. After trying everything (soft reset, hard reset, factory reset, repair service centre) it still having the same problem. Was this some horrible plan to ensure your customers start hating the brand. I am not a heavy data or app user. And it still reboots! The time that it worked, there was still a lag but manageable. But after the freezing screen and inability of service center to fix it, Mi- you have disappointed me. Amazon you should relook at the time the phone should be allowed an exchange.\n\n', "\n\n  Touch screen is smooth,quality of display is excellent,camera quality is good but not the best, little problem of overheating, speaker volume is low compared to other mi phones.clarity in voice is good Overall a good mobile at this price,Plz don't expect much from a budget phone\n\n", '\n\n  The full display, the battery life and the smooth touch because of latest Android and MIUI version makes it a good product. The rear camera is good (cant say great or best) and the front camera is poor. The sound is clear but you can actually feel its a Chinese product. The phone weight is not so heavy and the operation speed is quite good. The only best thing about this phone is unlock by the touch which is super fast. Overall I would recommend to buy if you are not a selfie fetish person and need phone for just calling, chat and web search with a big display and if you dont want to worry about the battery drain.

Perfect size for one hand uses, really compact 4. good for gaming, running pubg smoothly(medium graphics), SD625 is good enough for gaming. 5.Build quality is very sturdy 6. Sound quality is awesome over the earphones, as well as speaker.Cons- 1. Front camera is below average in indoor light 2. Dual VoLte is not available, I hope Mi will provide that in upcoming updates. 3. Ads in MIUI is really annoying, however this can be deactivated 4. Mi should have provided Pie update by now, however it still not avaliable.overall a good package uner 10k, specially who are tired of large display phones & looking for a compact one.\n\n', '\n\n  Phone is good for daily use i am not a hardcore gamer i just took this device for display and battery...\n\n', "\n\n  Very decent looking and good functionalityGot at good discount with exchange bonus - so great value for money.The only thing is that sometimes fingerprint reader doesn't work - first time that is - but on 2-3 tries it opens. Mostly opens on first try - may to do with phone being busy or free perhaps?Too much MI apps intrusion though - google is world leader (other than I-phone) - I would just let the customer rely on and leverage google (the choice is there but MI keeps asking for permissions - ultimately for peace of mind you tend to relent)\n\n", "\n\n  Bad bad bad.... Within 13 day it's front cam stopped working.. and when I contacted Customer care of MI... theysaid if it wud have been with in 10 days than we would have replaced it. Same with Amazon guys.. and after so many rounds of talks with Customer care where I have given them remote access to my device even.. now they are saying that you have to give your phone to service center for repair... How disgusting is that... Rite now m really feeling cheated by MI as wel as from Amazon. I have given 1 star as it was the minimum I can give for reviewing.. but they deserve no stars for this product... really disappointed...\n\n", '\n\n  Good product\n\n', "\n\n  I bought this phone around 10-12 months of its launch. There were Redmi note 7, 7 pro, 7A etc available for slightly more price. But I stick with this simply because its size at 5.84 inch is so compact and fits into small or average palms. Another of my requirement was 4GB ram and at least 64 GBROM both of which this phone matches.Processing is good and doesn't get heated while playing games like virua tennis pro etc. Battery lasts one full day for heavy usage and 1.5 days for average usage. Phone is kind of not very delicate and fallen down from my hands a number of times but caused no scratches or damage- still running on original plastic cover. Got an exchange value of Rs.2750 for my old redmi 4 which i exchanged and had to pay only rs.7250 for this.Overall a good buy I should say within the budget.\n\n", '\n\n  Though the phone is using hardware of its predecessor but packed in new display and body is giving it somewhat a closer look of iphone x . One can call it the cheapest replacement of an iphone x with almost similar user interface and unlock and emoji functions. The phone is lag free , good camera pic quality. I am not into gaming but multitasking is also lag free. Good response time. Though i got it as a non prime user so couldnt get the discount as amazon didnt give me one month trial subscription as the payment through debit card was reserved for only kotak and icici bank users, a big turn off and money making policy on behalf of amazon as debit card payment was open for 999 plan from any bank debit card. Overall the product is absolutely fine and also one thing the phone takes around 2.45 hrs to fully charge, bit of a disappointment. Otherwise this budget will meet your demand in many ways.\n\n', '\n\n  Battery:10/10 best battery life you can expect from a phone having 4000mAh battery.Camera:Rear:7/10Front:6/10Not a good choice for camera lovers.RAM management:7/10I can say OK not good not bad.Durability:8/10It is very durable and has a metal back.I myself have dropped it many times but not even a single damage occurred......Screen quality:9.5/10Yes,the best screen you can get.....If you are getting this in less than 9k then it is a good option for you......\n\n', '\n\n  Likes: build quality, look and feel, battery life(2 days), Newness in UI and UX, FHD play quality, No lag(octa core snap dragon processor),Dislikes: No 3GB/64GB option, poor indoor quality pictures, little bit bulky in thickness, no full screen display for videos(notch area unusable)The mobile is worth the money and is a good option to buy at this cost which comes with FHD display, snap dragon processor, many sensors and a big 4000mAh battery.\n\n', "\n\n  Mi 6 Pro is not at all a phone to buy..problems with this phone I faced:1. Charging adapter as well as the phone is heating seriously HIGH during charging. (This is the main biggest issue of this phone which I consider)2. RAM management of apps is not appropriate, but the phone can be treated just-a-good one for use for people who don't play games and mostly use Youtube, Chrome, music.3. Battery's performance is not upto the mark as stated by Mi. For eg: when you watch videos continuously for half hour on Youtube, it drains by 7% to 9% and back of the phone (where processor resides) starts heating, as you can feel the heat while holding it on your palm.4. You can feel the heat coming from the microphone to your ears while talking.I bought this for my mother and she complains that the phone is heating up a lot while charging. I talked to Amazon 3 times...seriously 3 times...to convince them that my problem is genuine and requested them for a replacement, if not returnable. But AMAZON does not compy to me. They checked the heating issue of the phone via Blancco diagnostic app which it registered a temp. range of 36 to 39 Fahrenheit...Firstly, the temp should be in CELCIUS guys...36 F is refrigerator's temp how can it be so hot, do you please understand this BLANCCO people?!! BLANCCO app is truly a cheat but Amazon will absolutely believe no one and only it.Seriously not satisfied with Amazon's attitude by not complying to my request to replace the phone.Because my friend also bought the same phone and he didn't encounter the heating issue. It obviously means that I received a defective product. So, I should get the replacement.Buy only the 'Note' series phones of Mi and nothing else, you'll get a better battery, better RAM management, best camera.\n\n", "\n\n  Nice mobile phone with good battery life. 4G VoLTE + 4G VoLTE was offered, (2 Jio Sims) but it was not supporting initially. Amazon offered an inspection and a total-illiterate guy came to check this device and failed to configure. Finally I've updated the software and the option to enable two 4G channels appeared.

With 4000 mAH lasts for two days as is claimed and is recharged fast with its charger . It has its own system of checking security including payment securities. Display of 5.84" is good enough. Display resolution of 2280 x 1080 is nice. However, the width should have been more broad for ease of viewing, writing and navigating. It has its good number of useful apps pre-installed that average users may not have to install third party apps like photo editing, notes, cloud storage, scanner, cleaner, compass, torch, etc. Cleaning app regularly checks and suggests cleaning of junk files, memory. Fingerprint lock and AI system is added security. System and security updates are available at regular intervals. The body is strong and solid. With dual rear camera the picture quality is very good even in low light conditions. Networking is good enough depending on the strength of available network providers. Sound quality is nice. The file manager is not convenient. The message management system is also cumbersome. Safety locking from accidental deletion of important messages is lacking. On the whole a nice buy.\n\n', '\n\n  The phone becomes nightmare sometimes frequently.It sometimes does not shows the  lock screen and does not wake up after repeated trying also.Making it useless  to use the phone in case of  emergency.Tried to send a picture after snapping but the send button did not work for several minutes, totally  annoying.No button or shortcut for the torch. Making it very much annoying.No  display of time when the  phone rings so you cannot check the time wile trying to answer a call.Some.Some fonts on the display is annoyingly small and there is no way to increase the fonts.The camera is not so good and fails to click a good image when the light is little bit low.Grains appears in the image if there is low light.Overall it seems the maker has hastily made the phone with several glitches and neglecting or sacrificing the user satisfaction.Feeling cheated.1 to 2 star is more than enough for this phone.\n\n', "\n\n  Things I liked about this device: üòäCompact: can easily fit even in small handsExcellent battery life: will surely last for a day even on very heavy usageMetallic body: feels sturdy in your handAudio Quality: It's great in both the cases (earphone and speaker)Things I didn't like about this device: ‚òπÔ∏èScreen: Although it's full hd screen, it looks dull and keeps flickeringCamera: Strictly average Camera PerformanceAs it has a small screen, video watching and gaming experience isn't that good.Conclusion: I bought it for ‚Çπ7200 after applying Bank discount.

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone.

Though I was really disappointed just after purchasing it the price further dropped to Rs.8,499/-! But it\'s a worthy buy under 10K. Now coming to the phone, the colour I ordered was blue and it is beautiful. The feel of the phone is perfect. Those who don\'t want a "big" phony yet want to flaunt it, it\'s perfect for them. The 5.84 inches FHD+ display is fluid and vibrant. The 625 Snapdragon chipset is a reliable processor for fast multitasking. The cameras are just ok , 5MP in the front and 12MP+5MP rear setup. Although it has AI face recognition, I would suggest you to avoid it as sometimes it may lag under low light conditions. The fingerprint sensor is smooth, unlocks in a giphee. Now the best part of the phone is it\'s battery life, the 4000mAh high capacity battery is surely to deliver a long lasting service. It runs on MIUI OS which is easy to use and people are getting familiar to this nowadays. To sum up, the phone is a competitive contender under the 10K segment of smartphones.\n\n', "\n\n  I bought this to upgrade from a Huawei Y6 II Compact and whilst the Huawei was a great phone and served me well over the past 2 years, the difference between that and this new Xiaomi is night and day.

Not only about the phone now about the service by amazon,When i lodged complaint more than thrice and what i got the reply from amazon tech support is that to use the phone with power saving mode to extend the battery life, and one of the funniest part is that they told normally a smart phone will get only battery life of 7-10 hours. this is the reply i got when i demand for the replacement or refund. One of the worst experience by amazon ,am not at all satisfied with the service and very bad battery performance so far after software updation, resetting and what ever customer execute told.\n\n', "\n\n  Good phone. The only drawback of the phone is, it has an old processor SD 625. The camera and others things are pretty good. I got 4+64 version of this phone at a good price in the Republic Day sale.

If you want some more better results you can buy it's successor Redmi Note 6 Pro.\n\n", '\n\n  Very good service and highest quality standards delivery and phone is very good\n\n', '\n\n  If your requirement is to have reliable Phone, then Redmi 6 pro will be the best choice.It has all necessary features with minimal price.basic camera, processing speed is not that fast, but if you go for battery and basic features, it satisfies more than any other android phone.

It was under warranty but still you don't want to visit the service centre so soon.Otherwise, performance wise it's going good.

Used social medias , shopping apps and checked all the features of this phone ...... And after all such testings some of the pros and cons are as follows :Pros :1. best ever battery . Hats off xioami for giving such great 4000mah battery at a very low price . 40% of battery always remains in my phone after using it for one full day continuously .2. good sound quality3. Processor is unimaginable ..... Its really fantastic4. Phone never hangs5. Both camera good under good lighting conditions6. Fingerprint sensor detects quicklyCons:1. Charger and battery gets heated...... U can use a lesser power battery ( 1A battery ) to prevent heating . The phone charger is 2A ... So  it gets heated2. Front camera not too good in darkConclusion :Best phone for budget consious people !!! Good response by amazon too !! Have fun with this beast !!!!!\n\n', "\n\n  Don't buy this mobile phone.1) Cameras are good but the worst part is the camera settings.2) Sound quality is good like other mobiles.3) I dont know the problem why this mobile gets hotter while talking on mobile even DATA and LOCATION services are switched off.4) Mobile hangs while playing games and the mobile is packed up with 4gb RAM.\n\n", "\n\n  I am writing this review after using this phone for almost one week.This device offers great specifications in the budget segment. Here are my reviews about the phone :-1. Face unlock works properly..and for this budget it's fast...The phone has a metallic finish and it's too handy to use...and the phone doesn't get hot during usage...The phone is lightweight too...2. Display - Display is great and auto brightness works very well.3. Sound - Sound is too high...clarity is very good.4. Battery - A full charge lasts for almost two days on normal usage.5. Camera - Camera is awesome for the price.. The portrait shots perfectly work with humans (blur level 1)..and found some irregular blurring with objects and animals..see the attached photos. Front camera is also great and we get many modes and watermark in the camera app.6. Call quality is great..and it works fine with secondary noise cancellation microphone..7. It has a dedicated micro sd card with with you can use 2simcards and volte also works fine..8. Fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate...\n\n", '\n\n  This is after three day use, Though its 4gb + 64gb but not up to mark, width is not up to mark, phone is not for enjoying videos, App takes time to open not laggs but heavy application take time to operate, Have used J7 prime previous to this for 1.6 years which I feel much smooth and fast than this phone, missing j7 prime. Battery life, music quality and call voice quality is good 25% battery remained even after whole day heavy use; still not very great phone as overall I found a slugish operation.\n\n', "\n\n  I was using Redmi Note 4, though it's still in very good condition, I gave it to my sister. And bought Remdi 6 Pro.I am a fan of Redmi, as previous phone didn't disappoint me. So expectation level was high for this phone.I just love the notch üòç looks so classy üëåTotally love this phone, only expectation is the camera, if the camera would be a little more nice, it would be better.But all together I simply love this Phone.\n\n", "\n\n  First of all its a Chinese phone. I have been using this after a year usage. Refrain from buying it.1.It's performance really reduce drastically to poor when the usage is slightly more than an average person. Like all Chinese product, quality is poor.2.Battery drains out too quickly now, survives the day on power bank. It's  really irritating when u have to charge it twice in a day. Charging rate has also reduced, charging pin also has become lose.3.Heating problem is quite significant, and I am no gamer.4. Camera is avg in daytime and pathetic during night. Selfie are still much better.5. Inbuilt apps really sucks the battery. No way to disable them.6. Mi cloud base, sms and other apps steals ur data, that's a separate story. Can never trust to keep anything important.7. I recommend not to buy any MI note series phones,they are all false configuration data to blind people, if U already hv it then use it as a landline r just dump it at home for attending or making calls for children. Even if they break it, it doesn't cost U much.\n\n", "\n\n  Bought this phone for my Dad and I am hoping it is built well and can withstand falls and scratches:-)Most of the apps needed upgradation and when upgraded the OS it started giving issues like volume buttons not working, device hung issues. After factory reset the issue somehow resolved. Asked for a tech visit from Amazon to check the device on 15th Oct(received the product on 11th OCT)..Good response from Amazon..Also Redmi puts screen cover (which makes it difficult to view the screen and needs to be removed) in the front and no temperred glass hence you need to go to the market to buy tempered glass which is not good. Also no headphones in the box.Front camera is not good but that's okay for a 10k phone. Also the design is not exciting compared to VIVO and OPPO full view phones.Overall good budget phone under 10k and if your priority is Full view screen and good RAM and processor.\n\n", "\n\n  Best budget phone for day 2 day task with descent amount of storage & ram. Also, it feels sturdy in hand one could easily get a confidence to use, even lookwise it's an decent phone niether too flashy nor too poor.

Overall a good package in budget one can easily relly on it.\n\n", '\n\n  First of all it hangs so much... You can see many lags clearly, The miui is not optimised properly particularly in this phone, phone feels weighted, weight distribution not done properly, at higher volume call speaker not working properly, games like pubg play at medium level only with some frame drops and lags.. Background apps quickly shut down and starts from first... Which is annoying all the time... Camera quality is average, snapdragon 625 is the biggest let down...  Only good thing is the battery life..\n\n', "\n\n  \xa0-Except for the notch display, I don't see this device as anything special worth of 10k INR.-Video and audio quality is upto the mark.-Haven't used that much right now but didn't see any lags.-Built is as usual good, feels sturdy with the metal frame and back.-3 GB RAM, 32 GB storage feels very redundant at this price where we get a better camera & display with phones like Asus Zenfone Pro M1 with 4GB RAM, 64GB ROM for the same price.-I bought the Red color model but it looks more of a Pink than Red.-Camera is kind of alright looking at other phones in this segment, doesn't seem poor or much superior.OVERALL: I won't say this is value for money product since brands are now launching 4GB RAM models at 10k. Just for the notch, which isn't so great or even in my personal taste, you must not compromise with performance.\n\n", "\n\n  Touch screen not working properly. Battery back up very poor in new fone. It sucked all my contacts and blocked even Gmail backed contacts untill I logged into my account. Same problem with my husband's  mi 7 pro. And gave contacts only when mi account was given all permission after logging. This isserious security issue.vive ordered replacement. Hope to get a functional and new product. They have given me SUBSTANDARD product. They are not allowing me to choose some other brand despite so many issues at the outset.\n\n", '\n\n  Only plus with this phone is its good battery life however it does not look like 4GB/64GB phone due to hanging issue despite free memory of 1.7GB/44GB. Generally tough to have conference call as it hangs while adding another caller. This was not the issue with my old Redmi Note 3 ( 3GB/32GB) phone which I have used for almost 3 years and given to amazon under exchange scheme. I thought it was upgrade but actually it look like degrade as far as handling experience is concerned, not expecting this poor performance from Xiaomi phones.\n\n', "\n\n  Please go for it for this price range this is worthy.And about battery life it is awesome if keep an eye on some parameters like Don't overchargeAbout picture quality is overall good in every videos and i found picture quality is superb but when i open jiotv in full screen mode pixels of video quality is very poor even in high quality videoAnd thanks Amazon\n\n", '\n\n  Bought this for my Mother, she was earlier using a Samsung, I must say the moment I opened the box I fell in love with the device, the notch design is graceful, moreover with the new update the UI is even crisper and better than it competitors... The only thing that nags me though is it is not thin enough!Otherwise for medium users (calls, whatsapp, browsing, FB and few other apps) it is a good option. I would give it an overall rating of 4/5, Only because of its thickness, rest all specs - Its a winner as always from MI. And amazon is AMAZE-on...the delivery schedule & packaging is marvelous!\n\n', "\n\n  \xa0I have used oneplus6 and would say that this phone is totally a value for money.One thing better than oneplus is the form factor of this phone.

Hangs 2 times among those 3 months, did force restart, then all become fine.2. Front camera is not good as expected.3.

If you want to click more and more pic/video, then go for the higher memory range one.

I think that it is not a camera  phone like oppo or vivo but it is a phone which can/should be used for commercial use.Five stars are accurate for it.Thank You.\n\n", "\n\n  It's a good phone. But could have been better. Batts were amazing when the phone was new. But after using it for just two months, it seems to be discharging really fast. Charges pretty quick though. I expected the camera to be better. Image quality is shitty in low light. Finger print scanner seldom works. But phone doesn't freeze or hang even on using multiple apps at the same time, which is it's one saving grace.\n\n", '\n\n  Product is good, but service is pathetic.

The front camera is very much bellow average in low light it's literally impossible to capture or record anything.A part from the camera qualities the phone is very easy to handel and the compact nature of the device gives a pretty classy look.The device weighs a bit heavy but that's not a big deal.The sound quality of the speaker's are also average.\n\n", "\n\n  Purchased 32gb verient on 1st sale. It is a very good budget phone. No problem till now. Running smoothly. No heating problem. I am not a gamer, so i didn't test heavy games on it. Notch design is little bigger. Overall a value for money phone.\n\n", "\n\n  The red color is finer and even more glossier than in picture. I got mesmerized as soon as i turned the phone back. Moreover picture quality is great. 60fps suits well on it. The face unlock works in micro seconds with only a second of calibration unlike in iphone X where you have to rotate our face multiple time to calibrate. The small frame videos can be zoomed to fill the screen without cutting any part of it. Camera Portrait mode is amazing, I took my mom's first pic on it, she just awed. The 5.8 inch screen is just good and it's quite handy to use in one hand.The courier guy came to me and just checked the IMEI and i received the phone in exchange. It cost me INR 7000. Thanks amazon for coupons and easy exchange policy.Though the front cam is a little shortcoming for picture quality, i would have to say i am not a selfie lover.Thank you Jeff Bezos!!\n\n", '\n\n  Dont buy this product, dual 4g is not active at same time..hanging issue, I was using 3s prime from last 3 years it works better than this phone in all aspect..I happened to be blind fan of MI till I purchased this phone.

Go for a pro version if you are aiming for Redmi 6.Coming to most important feature, Camera. Am really disappointed with camera\'s performance. No Portrait mode in selfie.

You can't uninstall them and storage is not that which is shown in every mi phones it's should be what exactly we can use not what is total memory of phone means (excluding) the min reserved storage for the phone . battery is getting heat in this phone and hanging so with this  getting frustrated. I think we as customer feeling like mi is not what it was known for as every day you are lounching new apps like mi player, mi pay and so many more which you force to use as we can't uninstall them I can't tell you all but pls try to give customers his choice which app he should allow to use not what you throw by  your brand\n\n", '\n\n  I have moved from a Samsung to this phone. I find the phone to have a great built and an excellent quality of battery back up. With 60% of battery, I can survive the entire day.However, there is a frequent issue while using dual sim cards. Most of the times, suddenly my one sim card goes missing and need to restart the phone, and then again the sim gets detected. However, this needs to be checked if every phone has this issue, as my phone has this issue at least 3 times a week.Rest for the money the phone is good i love the sub 6" phone size which makes it a handy phone for use, and I love it that the phone works well with Youtube and the data also is fine with both the sims.Unfortunately, I am amazed that the phone does not pair with an MI Bluetooth earpiece.

For the current price and choice of phones available in market i would say it is not a value for money phone. If the price of 3 GB Ram and 32 GB storage variant is near about 6k to 7k then I would recommended. I bought for 11k. With respect to that times market this deal was overpriced but still could be considered due to notch display, metal body, face unlock, dual camera, image stabilizer, and obviously finger print sensor.Processor was good at one time but it is little outdated and in this phone I feel there is a issue with optimisation. Performance is quite balanced but playing games like pubg will be like phones with snap dragon 425. Why buy an outdated phone when you have a new phone coming every week.\n\n', '\n\n  The Redmi 6 pro comes with excellent features as all are mentioned in the website.Firstly thanks to amazon to deliver the product within 2 days.Secondly MIUI 10 interface is awesome.It is not possible to explain here without using it practically.Thirdly screen split option allow users to use multiple applications simultaneously which is an awesome experience.Fourthly face unlock feature can sence your face almost in a dark environment.But two important things are needs to be addressed that future buyers of this phone should be concerned about,1. Picture quality of front camera as not good as website claims.2. No OTG cable is provided by mi.

So my humble request to all if you think twice before buying a low budget phone.\n\n", "\n\n  Funny thing with Amazon.The prefer sending all small and useless stuffs in bubbles wraps and air bags but send the phones in packets.The phone is good. It's Redmi 6Pro (A2) however on the website when we search for Redmi Note 6 Pro this phone comes up.Phone is Good though.\n\n", '\n\n  I bought this phone and was happy to have it till the replacement period was not over. As soon as return time got over, the phone started facing battery draining issues following the immediate day. And fingerprint sensor is worst in this smartphone it is slow and cannot read fingerprint at first touch.Feeling sick to have this phone.üòì\n\n', '\n\n  Worst experience everI have buy redmi 6 pro on 26 oct, i got delivery on 28th oct and on 30th of oct i have face one problem that charger is notworking.I was reached at service center on 2 novThey told me that your charging cord is damage so we do not able to give the replacement.But aise kuch bhi hua nahi tha mene charger sirf 1 hi bar use kiya tha aur vo logo ka kehena tha ki cod aapne hi damage ki heSo i would not only suugest bt i wont to approach to every one that please dont buy any product from #miAnd i would like to tell mi that companirs are not getting great by their sell bt companies are  reach to the no 1 position by their servicesSo service is most important than sellI would like to suggest u all to buy the smartphone like #samsung #1+ #appleHotel ka waiter bhi inse achi service deta he bhai\n\n', '\n\n  I have purchased the Redmi 6 Pro with the 4 GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage variation .I have used that phone and very good performance overall .Redmi 6 Pro is very smooth to use and very good battery back up to use the long time .the sound quality, camera quality, face unlock, fingerprint, stylish look and all inbuilt features is very good to used in regular life.the game graphic result is also very good.and the phone is under budget with many extra feature which is premium compare to other model and phone.Highly recommendedThanks Amazon and MI\n\n', "\n\n  Out of 64gb storage you will get only 45gb of Memory which is little bit considerable amount  19gb. The speaker is only one provided even though 2 speaker space provided at the bottom. Over all performance is good and worth of money what you spend. No other phone in this range gives you these many features. Battery backup is also excellent. It's one of the best phones available in this range.\n\n", "\n\n  First of all, I'm impressed with this phone. The process is cool. Its not lagging; everything is perfectly working fine.The Camera is the only thing I'm not satisfied with. I preferred the front camera to be at least a little bit more clear when shot at low lights. The Back camera is good. Overall my experience in this phone is great except for the camera.One more thing, the phone has two speakers at the bottom. One of them weren't working from the moment I opened the package. Well. didn't make much difference in sound as the single speaker made sufficient sound for me. So I din choose to make a complaint. So that's it. Thanks for reading this far.\n\n"]
