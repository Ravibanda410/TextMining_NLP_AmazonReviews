  SPOILERS AHEAD PEOPLE!!Murphy's idea is very simple. He says if you want something, just embed the idea into your non-resistive (Subconscious) mind.To be honest,in the beginning of the book i did not find the whole idea very logical. It seemed like somebody is trying to sell some BS. But then a realization came upon me...He says\"By embedding the idea into our sub-conscious we can get anything\". But, how???Now i feel i know how, as we force the idea into our mind we involuntarily start working towards it with our greatest capability using our full potential and thus we have achieved what seemed initially impossible to us.All in all, this book was really helpful to me(although i am nearly living the best years of my life). If it can help a person who is really satisfied with his life, i have no idea how many wonders it will do to those people life who want something really bad and need anything to help them with their goal.

  I have no idea why people buy this one. I bought it reading the reviews. But this book is a waste of money. Only book I could never finish reading. The same thing is written chapter after chapter. Learn from the author how to stretch a one page idea to a 350+ page book. Also most of the incidences are too supernatural that they are coincidental and not scientific unlike what the book claims.I'm a book lover and this is the only book I regrer buying.

  It is just about self hypnosis or self suggestion, that too if you stretch it to sound more scientific. In reality, it is about miracles (literally) occurring with  self suggestion. Very irrational.. .. with self suggestion somebody gets the dress she wanted as a gift or a somebody who was alone gets into a relationship (here some psychological rationale can be attributed...)I thought the book would be some thing scientific, but it was more based on belief. So personally it was a let down. But even though, I am an atheist, I do not depreciate the power of belief on people who believe in these... Ultimately whatever keeps you in a positive frame of mind is good, if it doesn't infringe on others' peace of mind. This book in that aspect is good, gives people better than God to believe in... yourself, or the unknown self...If you want to know how these miracles can help or to know other people s experiences, this may be a very good book and might help you.But personally for me it is a two star...

He says if you want something, just embed the idea into your non-resistive (Subconscious) mind.To be honest,in the beginning of the book i did not find the whole idea very logical. It seemed like somebody is trying to sell some BS. But then a realization came upon me...He says\"By embedding the idea into our sub-conscious we can get anything\". But, how???Now i feel i know how, as we force the idea into our mind we involuntarily start working towards it with our greatest capability using our full potential and thus we have achieved what seemed initially impossible to us.All in all, this book was really helpful to me(although i am nearly living the best years of my life). If it can help a person who is really satisfied with his life, i have no idea how many wonders it will do to those people life who want something really bad and need anything to help them with their goal.

  I have no idea why people buy this one. I bought it reading the reviews. But this book is a waste of money. Only book I could never finish reading. The same thing is written chapter after chapter. Learn from the author how to stretch a one page idea to a 350+ page book. Also most of the incidences are too supernatural that they are coincidental and not scientific unlike what the book claims.I'm a book lover and this is the only book I regrer buying.

  It is just about self hypnosis or self suggestion, that too if you stretch it to sound more scientific. In reality, it is about miracles (literally) occurring with  self suggestion. Very irrational.. .. with self suggestion somebody gets the dress she wanted as a gift or a somebody who was alone gets into a relationship (here some psychological rationale can be attributed...)I thought the book would be some thing scientific, but it was more based on belief. So personally it was a let down. But even though, I am an atheist, I do not depreciate the power of belief on people who believe in these... Ultimately whatever keeps you in a positive frame of mind is good, if it doesn't infringe on others' peace of mind. This book in that aspect is good, gives people better than God to believe in... yourself, or the unknown self...If you want to know how these miracles can help or to know other people s experiences, this may be a very good book and might help you.But personally for me it is a two star...

He says if you want something, just embed the idea into your non-resistive (Subconscious) mind.To be honest,in the beginning of the book i did not find the whole idea very logical. It seemed like somebody is trying to sell some BS. But then a realization came upon me...He says\"By embedding the idea into our sub-conscious we can get anything\". But, how???Now i feel i know how, as we force the idea into our mind we involuntarily start working towards it with our greatest capability using our full potential and thus we have achieved what seemed initially impossible to us.All in all, this book was really helpful to me(although i am nearly living the best years of my life). If it can help a person who is really satisfied with his life, i have no idea how many wonders it will do to those people life who want something really bad and need anything to help them with their goal.

  I have no idea why people buy this one. I bought it reading the reviews. But this book is a waste of money. Only book I could never finish reading. The same thing is written chapter after chapter. Learn from the author how to stretch a one page idea to a 350+ page book. Also most of the incidences are too supernatural that they are coincidental and not scientific unlike what the book claims.I'm a book lover and this is the only book I regrer buying.

  It is just about self hypnosis or self suggestion, that too if you stretch it to sound more scientific. In reality, it is about miracles (literally) occurring with  self suggestion. Very irrational.. .. with self suggestion somebody gets the dress she wanted as a gift or a somebody who was alone gets into a relationship (here some psychological rationale can be attributed...)I thought the book would be some thing scientific, but it was more based on belief. So personally it was a let down. But even though, I am an atheist, I do not depreciate the power of belief on people who believe in these... Ultimately whatever keeps you in a positive frame of mind is good, if it doesn't infringe on others' peace of mind. This book in that aspect is good, gives people better than God to believe in... yourself, or the unknown self...If you want to know how these miracles can help or to know other people s experiences, this may be a very good book and might help you.But personally for me it is a two star...

  SPOILERS AHEAD PEOPLE!!Murphy's idea is very simple. He says if you want something, just embed the idea into your non-resistive (Subconscious) mind.To be honest,in the beginning of the book i did not find the whole idea very logical. It seemed like somebody is trying to sell some BS. But then a realization came upon me...He says\"By embedding the idea into our sub-conscious we can get anything\". But, how???Now i feel i know how, as we force the idea into our mind we involuntarily start working towards it with our greatest capability using our full potential and thus we have achieved what seemed initially impossible to us.All in all, this book was really helpful to me(although i am nearly living the best years of my life).
